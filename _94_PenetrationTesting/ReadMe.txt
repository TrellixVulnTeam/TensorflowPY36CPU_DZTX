The preferred solution is VMware Workstation running on a recent version of Windows, such as Windows 10. An Internet connection will be required to allow you to download the supporting libraries and software packages, as necessary. Each of the detailed software packages and libraries will be listed at the beginning of each chapter..

Module 2: 
You will need to have Python 2.7, Apache 2.x, RHEL 5.0 or CentOS 5.0, and Kali Linux.

Module 3:
