Before using any of these code snippets you should run the setup.sh file.
Once that is complete you will be able to use the scripts without issue.
All code here is provided to showcase ways you can link methods of
exploiting systems with scripts and to fill voids those industry standard tools
do not provide.  Many new professionals ask, why are there no tools that do
these simple tasks.  The answer is simple, why does a whole tool need to be 
created for simple task that are unique, but time consuming to a particular environment.
I hope you enjoy this book and the scripts provided as much as I have writing it.
