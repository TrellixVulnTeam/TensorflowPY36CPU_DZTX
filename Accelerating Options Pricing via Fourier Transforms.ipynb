    "In the previous post, I introduced stock options and an algorithm for pricing them known as the Binomial Options Pricing Model. However, as we saw from a simple Python implementation, the computations for this algorithm are expensive, and it takes O(N2) operations to compute the options price for N timesteps away from expiration. However, it turns out there is a very clever way to accelerate this algorithm using the dicrete Fourier transform.\n",

    "Before using discrete Fourier transforms to accelerate the Binomial Options Pricing Model algorithm, we will first take some time to establish the definitions of the Fourier transform, its inverse, and several other useful mathematical tools. Begin by considering a sequence of values x0,x1,…,xn−1. In that case, we define the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a sequence X0,X1,…,Xn−1 where\n",

    "This equation can be understood in several ways. For instance, if you consider that the exponentials are simply basis vectors for the vector space of functions, the Fourier transform immediately reduces to simply a projection of the sequence {xj} onto the vector space, since each product xjei2πnjk is simply the projection onto a single basis vector. The Fourier transform can also be viewed as a matrix multiplication, since it is simply a linear transformation from the vector of xj observations into the frequency observations Xk.\n",

    "Viewing the Fourier transform as a linear transformation (via a matrix multiplication by the x⃗  vector) explains the scaling factor of 1n√, because that is the scaling factor necessary to make the Fourier matrix a unitary transformation. Unitary matrices have the incredibly useful property that for a unitary matrix A, the inverse A−1 is equal to the adjoint operator (conjugate transpose) A∗. With this in mind, we can define the inverse Fourier transform easily by noting that the Fourier transform is symmetric and thus the conjugate transpose is simply the conjugate of each term, and thus we simply need to change the sign in the exponential. Thus, we obtain the expression\n",

As θ increases, this vector traces out the unit circle, rotating around it. Since the exponentials can be viewed as unit vectors rotating along a circle, the Fourier transform and the inverse transform really only differ in that one of them has exponentials rotating in the counter clockwise direction (e−iθ) while the other has them rotating in the clockwise direction (eiθ). Thus, they only differ by which elements of the sequence get multiplied by which exponentials. In the Fourier transform, the elements are chosen “counter-clockwise”, while in the inverse Fourier transform, the elements are chosen “clockwise”. Mathematically speaking, we can define a reversal operation\n",

    "Although this result is certainly interesting and impressive, it may not be immediately obvious why this is crucial and how this speeds up the computation of the options price. Suppose that computing the Fourier transform or inverse Fourier transform of an N-length sequence takes at most some time f(N). For this algorithm, we must compute the transform of q and the transform of CN, and at the end compute the inverse transform of the entire expression above, so we will ultimately spend 3f(N) units of time computing Fourier transforms. In addition, we will need to raise the components of F(q) to the Nth power, which is a constant time operation for each component, and will thus take cN time (since we need to do it for each of the N components). Thus, the total time spent will be cN+3f(N); therefore, if we can devise some way to compute the Fourier transform faster than O(N2), we will have an algorithm that is provably faster than the naïve Binomial Options Pricing Model and even the optimized dynamic programming algorithm (which runs in O(N2)). Luckily, algorithms for computing the discrete Fourier transforms have been well studied, and there exists an algorithm known as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which can compute the transform in time upper bounded by O(NlgN).\n",

For the simple version of this algorithm, we must assume that the length of the sequence N is equal to some power of two; however, although this is a significant obstacle, there are several ways to overcome it described extensively in the literature (which we will not describe).\n",

In addition, it is clear that for small enough sequences (say, N=3), the amount of time necessary to compute the discrete Fourier transform via the original formula is negligible and can be assumed to be constant; this small case will form the base case for recursion. We will now verify that this algorithm is efficient by computing the running time.\n",

    "Compute the total Fourier transform via the piecewise equation above. Return the Fourier transformed sequence.\n",

    "Each of these steps can be analyzed in order to determine the amount of time they take. The first step, computing the length, takes a constant amount of time, since the data is stored in an array of known length. The second step will either take a constant amount of time (if we’re computing the transform for a small sequence), or will take no time at all if we skip it. The third step will take an amount of time proportional to the size of the sequence, since we must iterate over the sequence and place each element into a new array. The last step will also take a time proportional to the size of the sequence, since we must compute a simple mathematical expression which takes constant time for every element in the sequence. Thus, we have found that the total time necessary for all the steps excluding the recursion is linear in the sequence, and thus each recursion incurs O(N) overhead."

    "In order to compute the total running time, imagine the computation tree generated by this algorithm. The top level of the tree incurs N work. The next level of the tree has two nodes and each one incurs N/2 work, so in total they incur N work. The next level has four nodes, each of which incurs N/4 work, so once more the total at that level is N overhead. Since each next level reduces the sequence lengths by a factor of two, there must be no more than lgN levels, and thus the total amount of work is bounded by the number of levels times the overhead at each level, which is O(NlgN). Thus, we have shown that the discrete Fourier transform can be computed quickly in O(NlgN) time.

    "In these two blog posts, we derived the Binomial Options Pricing Model, an alternative to the commonly used Black-Scholes model for computing option prices. The binomial model is superior to Black-Scholes because it allows for the possibility of exercising the option prematurely, thus allowing for computing prices of American and Bermudan style options in addition to European style options. However, the computational complexity of the binomial model is a significant disadvantage, especially since the complexity grows quickly as the time until the option expiration date increases. We define several mathematical tools such as discrete Fourier transforms and discrete convolutions, which we then use to rederive the binomial model using Fourier transforms. Finally, we implemented both the naïve O(2N) algorithm (which can be accelerated to O(N2) with dynamic programming) and the Fourier transform based O(NlgN) algorithm, and verified that they gave the same results for the same inputs. Thus, the use of Fourier transforms significantly increases the applicability of the binomial options pricing model, as it speeds up the algorithm by a factor of NlgN, allowing accurate pricing of American style options at high speeds."
